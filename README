ec2-elasticizer
---------------

This is a simple script that uses the Amazon APIs to assign an elastic IP
address to an EC2 instance on boot.

The address can either come from a YAML config file or be embedded in the
user data of the instance.

System Requirements
-------------------

- perl v5.10
  - Net::Amazon::EC2
  - YAML

Configuration
-------------

A sample configuration is in the etc director.  You need to configure

- the address
- the AWS region
- your accesskey
- your secretkey

Optionally, you can configure the instance ID in the configuration by
setting instance-id-source to 'config' and setting instance-id to the ID to
use.  This allows you to use ec2-elasticizer from somewhere other than the
EC2 instance you are attaching the address to.

Usage
-----

./ec2-elasticizer [--configfile file] [--verbose] [--debug] [--force]

  configfile defaults to $FindBin::Bin/../etc/ec2-elasticizer.yaml
  verbose is off by default and adds some additional output to the script
  debug turns on Net::Amazon::EC2 debug logging
  force will dissassociate the address from another instance if it is attached
